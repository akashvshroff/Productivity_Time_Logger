# Outline:

- A time logging productivity tool that helps you log time spent on activities, storing data in an excel sheet through openpyxl and analysing the data with matplotlib. A more detailed description, alongside sample outputs lies below.

# Purpose:

- Productivity is something a lot, if not most of us struggle with - myself included - and therefore when my friend approached me and asked me to build him a productivity tool, I was extremely intrigued. I wanted to build a minimal yet useful product that I would end up utilising myself and so I arrived at my build - a means to log time spent on different activities throughout the day, which can be very effectively visualised using an excel sheet where the rows are labelled to different times, by default 07:00 to 24:00 in 15 minute increments, and each column is a particular day. The build also helps analyse the time logged - showing you how much of your day you have logged and what have you logged the most as well as a pie chart of all the logged data.
- Building this system was wholly engaging and challenging - teaching me not only how to better work with modules such as openpyxl and matplotlib but also, and in my opinion more importantly, deciding how to keenly store data and reuse it in the most efficient way, alongside how to make the entire program more usable by allowing the users to make mistakes and explicitly handling errors. I loved programming this project.
